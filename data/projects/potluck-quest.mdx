Devised after an evening with far too many varieties of potato salad,
[Potluck Quest](https://potluck.quest) helps friend groups organize food for
gatheringsâ€”from birthdays to holidays to game nights.

My friends tend to use [Discord](https://discord.com) to keep in touch, so this
application is a monorepo that dual-deploys a Next.js
[website](https://potluck.quest) and a
[Discord bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1314705751381643308).
Event-goers can do most of their planning and chatting on Discord or seamlessly
take advantage of the additional functionality the website offers.

Want some dish ideas, or not sure how many signup slots to create? The
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) integration makes it easy by generating
suggestions based on your event details and dropping them into signup slots for
you to use or edit.
