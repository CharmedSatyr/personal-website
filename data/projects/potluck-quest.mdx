Devised after an evening with far too many varieties of potato salad,
[Potluck Quest](https://potluck.quest) helps friend groups organize food for
gatheringsâ€”from birthdays to holidays to game nights.

My friends tend to use [Discord](https://discord.com) to keep in touch and don't
want to type a lot of boilerplate, so I'm working to integrate this app with a
custom Discord bot and suggestions from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to make
planning quick and easy.
