I hadn't joined a game jam in a while and made this project as a solo submission
for
[Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/toot-ascension-4),
which had the theme "Bubble."

Players play as a bubble born from an unfortunate underwater accident. Their
task is to escape to the surface by avoiding obstacles, hazards, and underwater
enemies. They can grow and gain "ammo" by collecting and absorbing other
bubbles, and they can shrink to become more manueverable and stun underwater
enemies by shooting bubbles.

A gameplay video is available
