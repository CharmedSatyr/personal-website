Christmas Delivery Race is a holiday-themed _Paperboy_-like that I worked on
with a small team for the 2023 Activision Blizzard King Game Jam with Unity.

Playing as a flying Santa figure (we didn't manage to upgrade the sprite),
players are tasked with dropping presents down all the chimneys in the
neighborhood and collecting as many sweets as possible before the sun rises.
