In this miniature,
_[Papers, Please](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please)_-inspired
mechanical prototype, you get to experience first hand the difficulties facing
A-OK #1 Animal Shelter. Match a animal (or don't!) with a prospective client and
hope that your diligence is enough to keep the shelter's doors open.

The game features three potential outcomes depending on the player's choices.

This was a solo entry for the
[Ludum Dare 55 Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/puppies-please).
I decided to try out [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) for this project, and I
hand-drew some very scruffy animals.

A gameplay video is available [here](https://youtu.be/UlGzKydTFtQ).
