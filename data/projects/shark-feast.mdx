Shark Feast is an arcade-style adventure game that allows players to control a
hungry shark. Although the shark starts small and vulnerable, it grows as it
eats, allowing it to consume ever-larger enemies and even break through walls to
reach the mysterious totem at the end.

This was the capstone project for my
[Certificate in Game Design at the University of Washington](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/game-design).
The program's coursework involved producing dozens of game design documents,
technical documents, slide decks, presentations, and a tabletop game, but this
is the first digital game I programmed.

I served as the Studio Lead for our team of four, The Dimension Doors, primarily
because I was the only member with previous software development experience.
