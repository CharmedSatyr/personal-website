Shark Feast is an arcade-style adventure game that allows players to control a
hungry shark. Although the shark starts small and vulnerable, it grows as it
eats, allowing it to consume ever-larger enemies and even break through walls to
reach the mysterious totem at the end.

This was the capstone project for my Certificate in Game Design program at the
University of Washington. The program's coursework had involved producing game
design documents, technical documents, presentations, and a tabletop game, but
this is the first digital game that I had a hand in.

I served as the Studio Lead for our team of four, The Dimension Doors, primarily
because I was the only member with previous software development experience.
