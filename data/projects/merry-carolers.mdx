You're a Merry Caroler! This
[Pikmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin)-inspired point and click game
lets you walk about the city spreading cheer and gathering others to join your
song. Each caroler performs a unique part in one of two possible carols composed
for the game and will help you push through the snow. The game ends once you've
assembled all possible carolers and reached maximum Merriment.

This was a project by The Merry Carolers Team for the 7th Annual Seattle Indies
Game Jam, which had the theme "The More the Merrier."

I was a programmer for this game. The original music and audio implementation is
by [Jesse Colford](jessecolford.com).

A trailer Jesse made is available
