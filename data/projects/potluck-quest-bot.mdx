My friends tend to use [Discord](https://discord.com) to keep in touch, so I'm
writing this custom bot to integrate with [Potluck Quest](https://potluck.quest)
to make planning shared meals quick and easy. I envision an experience where
event hosts can use a combination of a bot and website to manage events and
create signup slots, and guests can express interest in events and sign up to
bring potluck dishes without leaving Discord.
