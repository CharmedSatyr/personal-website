# How I Learned to Code

---

## tl;dr

I was broke and needed to pay off my student loans. I learned web development
with the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freeCodeCamp.org) community, ass power, and
[dozens of projects](https://github.com/orgs/CharmedSatyr-freeCodeCamp/repositories?type=all).
Later [coursework](https://github.com/charmedsatyr-401-advanced-javascript) for
[Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) earned me a certificate in
full-stack JavaScript.

## Lifestyle Design on a Budget

I adored my English and Philosophy courses as an undergraduate in New York, and
I treasured my time in London reading a Master's in Philosophy and Public
Policy. Aided by my schooling, my first career in politics involved several
slightly prestigious roles: on Obama's first presidential campaign, on Capitol
Hill, and fundraising with some very big names in American politics and culture.

Somehow, however, I had neglected to translate my experience into fame and
fortune. This became apparent when I was rejected for a $1000 loan to cover
expenses in Washington, D.C. Even if I went cold turkey on nice shoes, take-out,
and international travel, my student loans were eating me alive.

Impending penury aside, the dysfunction in our nation's capital had soured my
enthusiasm for public service. Inspired by _Moby Dick_'s Ishmael, who took up
whaling with similar motivations, I decided to see if I could get paid to travel
and live abroad. I took a few online courses and got a job as an English as a
Foreign Language (EFL) teacher in Changwon, South Korea.

I began an intensive bout of lifestyle design in a notebook on the plane to
South Korea in July 2014. Teaching was temporary; my next career needed to give
me more financial security. It needed to accommodate my wanderlust, if possible,
and it definitely could not have a high financial barrier to entry. Law school
was desirable but didn't fit the bill. Writing or teaching was unlikely to
placate Sallie Mae any time soon. My longsuffering
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenwrendogaming) wasn't taking
off. It felt like kicking the can down the road to start applying to culinary
school or Ph.D. programs. I looked into e-commerce, drop shipping, and affiliate
marketing schemes, but for various reasons they didn't click.

I'm extremely detail-oriented and enjoy tinkering. In previous jobs, I'd nerded
out on Excel formulas, precise word choices, and automating processes. As a
gamer, I seemed to spend at least as much time modifying game assets as playing.
Software development seemed to offer everything I was looking for: good
compensation, skill-based rather than formal qualifications, and the possibility
of working remotely.

I resolved on that flight to learn to code.

## Discovering My Technical Community Overseas

Where to start? I followed promising accounts on Twitter, searched for
tutorials, and read about software development online after long days in the
classroom. I didn't fully understand the differences among scripting languages,
development tools, or other resources I needed to embark on a career.

I don't think I knew a single software developer.

Online privacy and security had become hot topics following
[global surveillance disclosures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_global_surveillance_disclosures),
and I began to improve my security posture. I installed Tor, switched to
GNU/Linux and open source tools, encrypted my hard drive, and became more
deliberate on social media. I even badgered my family into using Signal for
encrypted group chats. These efforts were valuable but didn't add up to a career
track.

[Game development](/games) was a strong interest, but I lacked a clear entry
point for that as well. Fellow YouTubers and modders that I interacted with did
not have salaried roles in games.

I had started my second teaching position and moved to beautiful Busan, South
Korea when I found a social media post mentioning
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). A few people, mostly ex-pats,
would be meeting up on alternate Sundays at a local civic building to work
through the web development website's free curriculum, itself being developed by
a [former EFL teacher](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/quincylarson/).

**freeCodeCamp Busan**'s leader—another teacher—was engaging, motivated, and
made me feel welcome.
([He's written about this period](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/south-korea-will-pay-you-to-learn-coding-5947fa625659/)
and went on to become a successful software developer.)

After a few meetups, I knew this group was where I belonged. I started
completing coding exercises not only at meetings but in between. I appreciated
being able to make static pages with HTML, CSS, and tools like Bootstrap, but I
fell in love once I progressed to JavaScript. Scripting was powerful. It was
versatile. It was intellectually interesting. All the little bits of syntax I
was learning not only offered me new ways to solve problems but opened up the
possibilities of the digital age.

Though web development wasn't what I had in mind when I embarked on a career in
software, it would allow me to learn the ropes and gather a crew to help me
navigate more challenging waters.

## Ass Power ~ 화이팅!

Joining a club wasn't by itself enough to train my new skills to a professional
level. When people ask me if I learned Korean while teaching abroad, I sometimes
joke, "Nope, I learned JavaScript."

> Everybody wants to go to heaven and nobody wants to die. It's ass power, man.
> You have to be emotionally ready to put as much energy into it as it takes to
> make it right.

Along with 화이팅, or _Fighting!_, a Korean term of encouragement, I took
producer Quincy Jones's
[reflection on Michael Jackson's success](https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Musician/1980/1981/Musician-1981-09.pdf)
as my rallying cry. I developed **ass power**, the determination to sit in my
chair and work, putting sometimes 60 hours into training and coding projects a
week between 2016 and 2018. Although I enjoyed much of what Busan had to offer,
most days I woke up early and spent all day on code challenges or my latest web
application before walking along the beach to teach evening English classes.
Increasingly brutal student loan payments sometimes motivated me to code after
class, too.

With each project, I aimed to not only complete the acceptance criteria provided
by freeCodeCamp or other resources I found but to learn one additional thing.
Why not style with this
[stock market app](https://github.com/CharmedSatyr-freeCodeCamp/charmed_cash/tree/master)
with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)? Lemme try to optimize my
[Simon Game](https://github.com/CharmedSatyr-freeCodeCamp/simon_game)'s build
process with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)! Why don't I set up a Linux box and
host my own [Mastodon](https://www.mastodon.social) instance? How can I keep bad
actors from using my
[URL shortener microservice](https://github.com/CharmedSatyr-freeCodeCamp/url_shortener_microservice)
for their phishing links? Will creator Dan Abramov respond to my questions about
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) on Twitter? (Yes.)

At freeCodeCamp meetups, I'd share my work with other members and check in on
their progress. As time went on, I was able to help fellow students with their
projects.

I found broader communities as well. I completed three rounds of
[#100DaysOfCode](https://x.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) on Twitter, demonstrating
my (overly) consistent development practice and cheering others along with
theirs. I contributed code to a few open source projects. I started supporting
organizations like the [EFF](https://www.eff.org) and
[Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org). Some friends and I submitted the
winning project—a crowd-sourced, geo-mapping application—for the hackathon at
Google-sponsored Startup Weekend Busan.

I continued writing code for full-stack freeCodeCamp projects until I got my
first developer job in 2019. I earned
[multiple certificates](https://www.freecodecamp.org/charmedsatyr), and the code
for many of the projects I built has
[made its way into its own GitHub organization](https://github.com/CharmedSatyr-freeCodeCamp)
for safekeeping.

## The Release Pipeline

I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities and communities I've gained by
learning to code.

Although I've never gotten over my imposter syndrome as someone who transitioned
to a technical industry mid-career, in 2018 I took the plunge, quit my teaching
job, and started looking full-time for a software role. I had had some success
picking up freelancing projects for small businesses and academic clients, but I
needed a full-time gig.

After re-acquainting myself with family in Mississippi after years overseas, and
a discouraging number of unanswered job applications, I decided that I should
move somewhere well-known for its software industry if I wanted to give myself
the best possible prospects.

I also began looking at code bootcamps. I was confident that I had learned what
I could on my own, but I didn't know what I didn't know. Why weren't employers
responding to me? Where there gaps in my training plan? I'd spent time with
resources besides freeCodeCamp, and it seemed like there was no end to what I
_could_ learn. Did I need to earn a particular certification? Was my resume or
portfolio website not showcasing my abilities well? Was I too old to change
careers, as members of my family helpfully suggested, and destined to spend my
days at the front of a classroom?

I'd never been to Seattle, but it seemed like a good place for developers—home
to several prominent companies, near the ocean and mountains, and with a cheaper
cost of living than Silicon Valley. When I applied to
[Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), a bootcamp in the shadow of the
Space Needle, the admissions team allowed me to undertake a skills assessment. I
tested directly into the school's most advanced course for my stack,
[Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-401/advanced-software-development-in-full-stack-javascript/).
Instead of a series of courses spanning a year or more, I could get a
certificate, career advice, and networking opportunities by capping off my
education with a single class.

Reminiscent of my long voyage from Mississippi to New Hampshire to work for
Obama's 2007 campaign, or to South Korea in 2014 to become a teacher, I drove to
Seattle sight-unseen in January 2019 with the intention of starting a new life
as a software developer. The bootcamp turned out to intense and introduced me to
developers and developer communities in my new city. I determined that my
software skills were solid, but I did pick up some things I hadn't learned on my
own: [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) docs, Agile methodologies, and other tools
that shone for teams rather than solo developers.

When I got my first software developer job in August 2019, I was able to be
immediately productive. My ass power enabled me to rise from Associate Software
Developer to Senior Software Developer and Engineering Manager within four short
years.

I paid off my student loans.
