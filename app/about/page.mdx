# About

## Bird's eye view

- **Adventure, discovery, creativity.** Risk-taker. I try not to get too
  attached, and I love a new perspective. Happiest when making things.
- **Xenophile.** 29 countries visited. Some years spent abroad. Periods in
  London, Busan, Chiang Mai, Prague. I get to know places through local food and
  drink.
- **Slow thinker.** Philosophy, public policy, literary criticism, game design.
  Iteration is key. I make connections while writing, editing, refactoring.
- **Favorite things.** Farmers markets, good stories, open fire cooking.
- **Southerner in exile.** I live in Seattle, but my family's been in the
  southeastern U.S. for at least ten generations. I left the South on purpose
  but enjoy visiting.
- **D&D class: Wizard.** Potentially magical. Little claim to cunning or
  physical prowess. I can learn most spells with enough study.

## Mindset

The people I admire most lead multi-chapter lives. They are hard workers,
mindful, and dynamic. They are motivated by their work itself rather than by
specific outcomes. They change not only because their circumstances change but
because their relationships with themselves change.

## Work

I've worked in politics in Washington, D.C., taught English in South Korea, and
managed software developers in Seattle. Let's [connect](/contact)! I see my
future at the intersection of [writing](/field-notes), [code](/code), and
[game design](/games).
