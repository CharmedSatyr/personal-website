# About

## Bird's eye view

- **Adventure, discovery, creativity.** Risk-taker. I try not to get too
  attached, and I love a new perspective. Happiest when making things.
- **Xenophile.** 29 countries visited. Some years spent abroad. Long periods in
  London, Busan, Chiang Mai, Prague. I get to know places through local food and
  drink.
- **Slow thinker.** Philosophy, public policy, literary criticism, game design.
  Iteration is key. I make connections while writing, editing, and refactoring.
- **Favorite things.** Farmers markets, good stories, open fire cooking.
- **Southerner in exile.** I live in Seattle, but my family's been in the
  southeastern U.S. for at least ten generations.
- **D&D class: Wizard.** Potentially magical. Little claim to street smarts or
  physical prowess. I can learn most spells with enough study.

## Mindset

The people I admire most lead multi-chapter lives. They are hard workers,
mindful, and dynamic. They are motivated by their work itself rather than by
specific outcomes. They change not only because their circumstances change but
because their relationships with themselves change.

## Communities

- [Penn's Sunday School](https://pennsundayschool.com/). A member of the
  congregation since 2012.
- [Arnold's Pump Club](https://arnoldspumpclub.com/). My personal trainer Is
  Numero Uno.

  space for game developers.
