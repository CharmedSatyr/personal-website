						I love learning, traveling, and a different point of view. I have
						visited 29 countries, lived in several, and prefer not to own too
						many things. I've worked in politics in Washington, D.C., taught
						English in South Korea, and managed software developers in Seattle.
						I have a master's degree in Philosophy and Public Policy. My
						favorite days involve sailing or open-fire cooking. I order the
						thing on the menu that I've never had, extra spicy.

						The people I admire most tend to lead multi-chapter lives. They are
						hard workers, mindful, and dynamic. They are motivated by process
						rather than outcomes. They change not only because their
						circumstances change but because their relationships with themselves
						change.
