			<h2 className="title mt-6">Mindset</h2>
			<p>
				The people I admire most lead multi-chapter lives. They are hard
				workers, mindful, and dynamic. They are motivated by their work itself
				rather than by specific outcomes. They change not only because their
				circumstances change but because their relationships with themselves
				change.
			</p>

			<h2 className="title">Work</h2>
			<p>
				I've worked in politics in Washington, D.C., taught English in South
				Korea, and managed software developers in Seattle. I see my future at
				the intersection of writing, code, and game design. Find me on{" "}
				<Link href={siteMetadata.linkedin}>LinkedIn</Link>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I engage with software development as a craft rather than science or
				art. I want to write code that is useful, respects users, and delivers
				business value. My development practice is constant iteration
				constrained by practical objectives.
