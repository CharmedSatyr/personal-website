# Games

I'm passionate about games as interactive creative media, learning tools, and
laboratories for understanding human behavior.

## Leveling Up

In 2023, I completed a Certificate in Game Design from the University of
Washington. I've developed
[several game demos published on itch.io](https://charmedsatyr.itch.io) and have
participated in four game jams. I am active in the
[Seattle Indies](https://www.seattleindies.org/),
[Duckfeed.tv](https://duckfeed.tv), and Bethesda game modding communities like
[Lexy's](https://lexyslotd.com).

I average one digital game per week and take notes on everything I play. I enjoy
many different types of games but gravitate toward toward smaller, single-player
titles. Want a recommendation? Try out
[Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/) or the games of
[Lucas Pope](https://dukope.com).

I run or participate in a few tabletop roleplaying sessions a monthâ€”games like
[Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com),
[Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark), or
[Call of Cthulu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/).

Years ago, I made over 200 gameplay and tutorial videos for
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenwrendogaming) and had a blast doing
voice work for the
[Skyrim Book Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nckf8AeBig&t=31s).
