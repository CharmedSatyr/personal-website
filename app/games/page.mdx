# Games

I'm passionate about games as interactive creative media, learning tools, and
laboratories for understanding human behavior.

## Leveling Up

In 2023, I completed a Certificate in Game Design from the University of
Washington. I've developed a few experiments on
[itch.io](https://charmedsatyr.itch.io) and have participated in four game jams.
I am active in the [Seattle Indies](https://www.seattleindies.org/),
[Duckfeed.tv](https://duckfeed.tv), and [modding](https://lexyslotd.com)
communities.

I average one digital game per week and take notes on everything I play. I often
enjoy single-player digital games with strong narratives, exploration and
survival mechanics, role-playing, turn-based tactics, or immersive sim elements.

I run or participate in a few tabletop roleplaying sessions a monthâ€”games like
[Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com),
[Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark), or
[Call of Cthulu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/).

Years ago, I made over 200 gameplay and tutorial videos for
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenwrendogaming) and had a blast doing
voice work for
[Skyrim Book Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nckf8AeBig&t=31s).
