# Games

I'm passionate about games as interactive creative media, learning tools, and
laboratories for understanding human behavior.

Games often involve rule-based systems that create incentives and disincentives
for different types of player interactions. Some games are fun, but not all
games are meant to be fun (see [Papers, Please](https://papersplea.se/) or
[That Dragon, Cancer](https://www.thatdragoncancer.com/)).

Because games are interactive, they can build empathy by putting the player in
unusual situations or forcing them to make difficult choices. The nature and
balance of their rules creates economies of action that can support myriad
different themes.

When designing games, I am often reminded of problems I encountered while
studying philosophy and public policy in school. It can be challenging and
rewarding to think about not only what a game world _should_ look like, but what
balance of rules are both feasible to implement and would support the world I
envision.

## Leveling Up

In 2023, I completed a Certificate in Game Design from the University of
Washington. I've developed
[several game demos published on itch.io](https://charmedsatyr.itch.io) and have
participated in five game jams. I am active in the
[Seattle Indies](https://www.seattleindies.org/),
[Duckfeed.tv](https://duckfeed.tv), and Bethesda game modding communities like
[Lexy's](https://lexyslotd.com).

I average one digital game per week and take notes on everything I play. I enjoy
many different types of games but gravitate toward toward smaller, single-player
titles. Want a recommendation? Try out
[Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/) or the games of
[Lucas Pope](https://dukope.com).

I run or participate in a few tabletop roleplaying sessions a monthâ€”games like
[Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com),
[Pathfinder](https://paizo.com/pathfinder),
[Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark), or
[Call of Cthulu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/).

Years ago, I made over 200 gameplay and tutorial videos for
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wenwrendogaming) and had a blast doing
voice work for the
[Skyrim Book Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nckf8AeBig&t=31s).
