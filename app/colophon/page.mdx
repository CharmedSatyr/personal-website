This website is under construction using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and
deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

{/* eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-expressions */} The site was last updated
on {lastUpdated}, and I am making frequent updates.
