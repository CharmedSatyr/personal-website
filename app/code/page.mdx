# Code

I am a passionate software developer and technical lead who likes to build
products that solve problems. My wife ‚ô•Ô∏è is a Product Manager, and we talk about
process a lot.

For me, code is a tool. I engage with software development as a craft rather
than as a science or art. I want to write maintainable code that respects users
and delivers practical value. Privacy and security are always first-order
concerns.

My years of experience in politics and education before
[I learned to code](/field-notes/how-i-learned-to-code) help me see the bigger
picture in an organizational context: I like to know _why_ we're building
something, _who_ we think it will help, and the _scope of benefit_ we should
expect to sustainably provide.

I advocate launching an
[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and iterating on it
in response to testing and user feedback rather than expecting a product or
feature to be perfect on launch.

Software problems are often people problems, and communication is one of the
more underrated skills in software development. Everyone is better off when
technical teams are fully aligned with product and business stakeholders.

In a manager or technical lead role, I keep in mind the
[ingredients of flow state](http://www.goodgamesbydesign.com/Files/FlowSpace_CMurphy_2016.pdf)
that I learned from studying [game design](/games). For a software developer
team to achieve a productive flow state, they need:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ol className="list list-decimal ml-8 mb-6">
	1. Clear Tasks
	1. Immediate Feedback
	1. Balanced Difficulty
	1. Minimal Distractions
</ol>

It can be tricky to get all these ingredients at once. üòâ
