# Code

## Solving Problems

I am a passionate software developer and technical leader who likes to build
products that solve problems. My wife ♥️ is a Product Manager, and we talk about
process a lot.

For me, code is a tool. I want to write maintainable code that respects users
and delivers practical value. Privacy and security are always first-order
concerns.
