# Code

I am a passionate software developer and technical lead who likes to build
products that solve problems. My wife ‚ô•Ô∏è is a Product Manager, and we talk about
process a lot.

For me, code is a tool. I engage with software development as a craft rather
than as a science or art. I want to write maintainable code that respects users
and delivers practical value. Privacy and security are always first-order
concerns.

My years of experience in politics and education before
[I learned to code](/field-notes/how-i-learned-to-code) help me see the bigger
picture in an organizational context: I like to know _why_ we're building
something, _who_ we think it will help, and the _scope of benefit_ we should
expect to sustainably provide.

A rising tide lifts all boats, and I believe that
[free, open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
licenses and decentralized, platform-independent formats and protocols both
empower users and benefit companies through the collective advancement of
technology. I support organizations like the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/about)
and [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/) that advocate for privacy, security, and civil
liberties in the digital space; I spent years running
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/)
instances; and I even ran a [Zcash](https://z.cash/) node before cryptocurrency
became a speculation.
[This website](https://github.com/CharmedSatyr/personal-website/blob/main/LICENSE)
and the
[dozens of my projects you can find online](https://github.com/CharmedSatyr) are
open source with copyleft licensing.

Software problems are often people problems, and communication is one of the
more underrated skills in software development. Everyone is better off when
technical teams are fully aligned with product and business stakeholders.

In a manager or technical lead role, I keep in mind the
[ingredients of flow state](http://www.goodgamesbydesign.com/Files/FlowSpace_CMurphy_2016.pdf)
that I learned from studying [game design](/games). For a software developer
team to achieve a productive flow state, they need:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ol className="list list-decimal ml-8 mb-6">
	<li>Clear Tasks</li>
	<li>Immediate Feedback</li>
	<li>Balanced Difficulty</li>
	<li>Minimal Distractions</li>
</ol>

It can be tricky to get all these ingredients at once. üòâ
