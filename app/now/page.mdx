# Now

_This is my [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page._

- I am currently grinding out code for [Potluck Quest](https://potluck.quest), a
  web app and [Discord](https://www.discord.com) bot for organizing potluck
  dinners. I have far more ideas for creative projects than I have time. I've
  experimented with different processes and ways of setting and tracking goals
  over the years, but lately I prefer to keep it very simple: focus on one thing
  at a time, have a clear vision, and put in the work.

- I live in Seattle with my wife Inga ♥️. We attended the Paris 2024 Olympics,
  have season passes to the Seattle Opera, play tabletop games a couple times a
  month, sail in the summers, and shop at the farmers market every Sunday. We're
  expecting a daughter this summer, our first child.
