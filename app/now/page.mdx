- I am currently working on [Potluck Quest](https://potluck.quest), a web app
  and [Discord](https://www.discord.com) bot for organizing potluck dinners.

- I live in Seattle with my wife Inga ♥️. We attended the Paris 2024 Olympics,
  have season passes to the Seattle Opera, play tabletop games a couple times a
  month, crew a friend's boat for sailing races in the summers, and shop at the
  farmers market every Sunday. We're expecting a daughter this summer, our first
  child.
