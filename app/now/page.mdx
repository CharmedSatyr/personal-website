- In January, my amazing partner Inga ♥️ and I got married in an unplanned
  ceremony in Las Vegas.

- Inga and I spent summer 2023 in Prague and are looking forward to attending
  the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics.

- I am working on a few personal projects, including an app to help coordinate
  potluck dinners, an adventure module for
  [Dungeons & Dragons 5e](https://dnd.wizards.com/how-to-play), and a digital
  game about shadows made with [Unity](https://learn.unity.com).
