- In January, my amazing partner Inga ♥️ and I got married in an unplanned
  ceremony in Las Vegas.

- Inga and I spent summer 2023 in Prague and attended three events at the Paris
  2024 Summer Olympics.

- I am working on a few personal projects. The one that's furthest along is
  [Potluck Quest](https://potluck.quest), an app for organizing potluck dinners.
