I worked most recently at
[Accretive Technology Group](https://accretivetg.com/), where I built and
maintained proprietary, platform-wide features that impacted hundreds of
business partners.

**My work included:**

- Extracting critical functionality for login, billing, and earnings reports
  from a convoluted legacy PHP monolith into React federated modules, Koa API
  gateways, and TypeScript microservices shipped in Docker containers.
- Leading the team that integrated multiple payment providers and built pay
  method selection, spending on multiple media and subscription types, and
  payment history into a new product using Next.js on a tight deadline.
- Building a platform-wide fraud-prevention system and stakeholder admin that
  supported real-time risk determinations and multiple friction types based on
  custom heuristics and machine-learning models. The system was built using
  Rust, MariaDB, Elasticsearch, Kafka, BigQuery, and Google Vertex AI, with
  integrations points in many other systems.
